# Project 5: ECG Arrhythmia Classification

**Reference Person:** [Raffaele Mineo](mailto:raffaele.mineo@unict.it)  
**Goal:** Classify 12-lead ECG signals for multi-label arrhythmia detection.

## Dataset

- **Name:** PTB-XL  
- **Description:** 21,799 clinical 12-lead ECG recordings (10 seconds each) from 18,869 patients. Each recording is annotated with up to 71 diagnostic statements, including rhythm, form, and diagnostic categories.  
- **Link:** [PTB-XL Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khyeh0719/ptb-xl-dataset)  
- **Size:** 3.2 GB  

## Methodology

Design and implement a deep learning model suitable for sequential ECG data, such as:
- 1D Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN)
- Transformer-based architecture

## Performance Evaluation

Evaluate model performance across different diagnostic tasks (e.g., specific arrhythmia detection) using appropriate **multi-label classification metrics**.
